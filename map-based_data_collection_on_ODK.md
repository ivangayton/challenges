# Concept

Between surveys, the field data collector may choose to be looking at a map screen rather than the standard menu. They can launch surveys from this map screen by:

- Clicking on existing map features, or
- Creating new features.

The resulting survey contains either a reference to the feature or the feature itself.

# The map screen

The map renders data in the following formats:

- MBTiles (raster)
- Vector Tiles
- GeoJSON
