## Micro-servers
Um, like this: [ODK Aggregate on Intel Edison](https://github.com/ivangayton/ODKAggregateOnEdison)

## Android-based server application for mobile data collection

A small web server running on an Android device that serves as an offline access point and aggregate server for OpenDataKit. Intended to facilitate large-scale data collection in low-income settings with minimal hardware dependencies and maximum use of locally available resources.
